# 📚 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## 💬 What is NLP?

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a subfield of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Linguistics** that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human language in a meaningful way.

It bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding.

## 🔍 Why is NLP Important?

NLP powers a wide range of real-world applications:

- 🔍 **Search Engines** (e.g., Google, Bing)
- 🗣️ **Voice Assistants** (e.g., Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant)
- 💬 **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**
- 📧 **Spam Detection and Email Categorization**
- 🌍 **Language Translation** (e.g., Google Translate)
- 📄 **Document Classification**
- 📝 **Text Summarization & Sentiment Analysis**
- 🔐 **Information Extraction and Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

## 🧠 Key NLP Tasks

| Task                        | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Tokenization**            | Splitting text into smaller units like words or sentences. |
| **Part-of-Speech Tagging**  | Identifying grammatical roles (noun, verb, etc.) of each word. |
| **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** | Extracting names, locations, dates, organizations, etc. from text. |
| **Sentiment Analysis**      | Determining emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral). |
| **Text Classification**     | Assigning categories to a given piece of text. |
| **Machine Translation**     | Translating text from one language to another. |
| **Text Generation**         | Creating meaningful text using language models. |
| **Question Answering (QA)** | Automatically answering questions from a document or passage. |

## ⚙️ Techniques in NLP

- 📐 **Rule-based Methods** – Using linguistic rules and grammars.
- 📊 **Statistical Methods** – Probabilistic models (e.g., n-grams, HMMs).
- 🤖 **Machine Learning** – Training classifiers using labeled data (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM).
- 🧠 **Deep Learning** – Neural networks like RNNs, LSTMs, CNNs, etc.
- 🚀 **Transformer Models** – State-of-the-art models that understand and generate language.

## 🚀 Modern NLP: Transformers

The biggest breakthrough in NLP has come from **Transformer-based architectures**, which have revolutionized the field with large-scale pretrained models like:

- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** – Great at understanding context.
- **GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)** – Great at generating coherent and meaningful text.
- **RoBERTa, XLNet, T5, DistilBERT**, and more.

These models are:
- Pretrained on massive datasets (unsupervised learning).
- Fine-tuned for specific tasks (supervised learning).
